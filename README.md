This project was developed by a team of four people in ten days' time, for the first round of group projects @ <Academia de Codigo_>'s bootcamp#29, taking place by the end of the 5th week of code learning as an introduction to Java simpleGFX and threads handling.

## Features
- Do you want to put a grim smile on your face? You will. Trust me.
- Fast paced game play.
- Difficulty is randomized by the speed they have and the distance that the enemies spawn on your play through.

## Build
`$ Ant build` the project (with the supplied build.xml)

Run the -jar file on the terminal and follow onScreen instructions.

`$ java -jar BADpotatoes.jar`

## Usage
- Run the -jar file from your machine and you should be good to go.

## Game rules
- Survive and kill all the potatoes.

## How-to play
- Use the keys `a` / `d` to move backwards or forward.
- Press `e` to attack the enemies in front of you.
